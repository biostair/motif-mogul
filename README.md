# motif-mogul
Tool for scanning for transcription factor binding sites in DNA

>**mogul**: _gaelic_ mesh, interstice of net

The goal of **Mogul** and related projects was to identify transcription factor
binding sites (TFBS) _in silico_ and reconstruct genetic regulatory networks.
MotifMogul was one of the basic, constituent tools.

The project was initiated at the Institute of Systems Biology in Seattle.
The originating PI for the project was Hamid Bolouri before the project transitioned to the new [Ilya Shmulevich lab](https://shmulevich.systemsbiology.org/).

A longer description of the project is still up [available on-line](http://xerad.systemsbiology.net/Mogul/).
